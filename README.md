The Four Seasons is a group of four violin concerti by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi, each of which gives musical expression to a season of the year.
Similarly we, human beings go through different moods everyday. Maybe your boss scolded you or your beloved one gifted you something. The mood you have today is the result of this cumulated experience.
In this app, you will record your mood with a sweet note or message every day. After some time you can look back and see how was your past days (ex: 70% bad day...). Also, there is a chat room with very sweet peoples, you can meet new friends there.
